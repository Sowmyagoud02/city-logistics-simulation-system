# City Logistics Simulation System

This is an end-to-end simulation and data engineering project that models city-wide delivery operations using discrete-event simulation.

### Features:
- Discrete-event simulation for delivery operations
- Random traffic and delay modeling
- Data pipeline into SQL database
- Analytics on delivery performance
- REST API for insights
- Future dashboard for visualization

More documentation will be added as the project progresses.
